#User wanting to access website
*whenever a user tries to access the website the user type in the name of the website eg:
"www.foobar.com" into the search bar then press enter or click on the go button.


#DNS (domain name system)
*the browser then send a DNS lookup request to resolve "www.foobar.com"
*the DNS server then returned ip associated with the IP of "www.foobar.com"


#SERVER
*Talking about a server in this case Nginx will be our used case
*Nginx acts as the web sever software installed on the server to serve clients it listens to
incoming HTTPS request on port 80(default for HTTPS)


#APPLICATION SERVER
*The application server(e.g. Flask,Django)hosts the website's application logic and dynamic
content for the website or application 
*it runs the server-side code responsible for generating web pages dynamically


#APPLICATION FILES(code base)
*let come down to the application files that contains the website codes, code base often
resides on the server and these code base are often textfiles
*these files can include text files like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP and some server side
scripting language like PHP and the rest


#DATABASE(Mysql)
*Mysql just like many other DBMS(database management system)it is for storing website data.
*It is also used for storing , retrieving and manipulation user/structured data such as user
accounts, posts and other application data.


#communication with user's computer:
*The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP protocol.
*When the user's browser sends an HTTP request, the server processes it and returns the
requested web pages or resources(HTML, CSS,JAVASCRIPT, images and many more).

issues of infastructure in designs and other
*************************************************************************

#SPOF(single point of failure):
*in situations where you are using only one server any hardware or software failure can lead to
downtime for the entire website.

#downtime during maintenance:
during maintenance some task like deploying of new code or updating server software, or the web
server may need to be restarted. and that could be a cause for the downtime.


#limited Scalability:
*in this case infastucture may struggle to handle sudden problems/spikes in incoming traffic,
as scaling are limited with only one server. this can lead to degraded performance or downtime
during period of high traffic.
